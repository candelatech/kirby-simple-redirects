# Basic Extensible Rerouter

Reroute URLs in a very basic format. Simply click the hamburger menu in the panel, click reroutes, and add your source and destination urls to the table. All reroutes use a type 301 (Moved Permanently) redirect, but the extremely simplistic nature of the codebase yeilds itself well to customization and extension.
